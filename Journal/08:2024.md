### Notes
- Talk about performance. Understand everyone have their own way to communicate. Stright and honest.
- I can do better. Outside work distractions, and I can work overtime to get back to it.
- What were you expecting me to progress? I want to know what to aim for. Please be specific
- What am I currently doing that is away from your vision? What about away from SDE1?

- What I noticed myself's problem:
  - Finding people experienced in core, that can point me to good resources
  - I am usually ignoring things that has to be reminded by Hans, which kind of makes me dependent on it. Any suggestions?
  - unblock from not working/bugs in core, can't be debugged in Co-pilot
  - Getting experience feedbacks on what I am doing.

- Solution:
  - Doing notes on what I learned / share it.
  - Read more code / have more discussion
  - engineering enablement / Froyd for core help?
  - What does others do when they are in my situation?
